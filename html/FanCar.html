            1. Students have to design a "20*30 cm" automative vehicle which is
            driven by a propeller.<br>
            2. The vehicle needs to keep itself on a track marked by black duct
            tape.<br>
            3. The vehicle needs to track a set of speed set points with error
            less than 5cm/s.<br>
            4. The vehicle needs to overtake another propeller driven vehicle 2
            times and overtook by that vehicle(also 2 times) when driving on an
            oval tack. <br>

            My job was to design the control system, including the software and
            hardware, to meet the course requirements. My design had following
            features:<br>
            1. I divided the job into 2 parts: the track follow control loop and
            speed control loop, and I deployed them individually on 2 different
            arduino board. This was because it could prevent a temporary failure
            in one loop to interfere another loop. I also connected 2 boards by
            I2C.<br>
            2. We used a series of infra-red sensor to detect the duct tape
            position. The track follow control was governed by a simple law: if
            the duct tape was in the left side, then the vehicle would turn
            right.<br>
            3. We used optical encoder to measure current wheel speed and used a
            PID controller to calculate the propeller motor torque command in
            order to control the car speed. We also recorded current mileage to
            determine when we wanted to "overtake" one another.<br>
            4. We used a ultra-sonic sensor to measure the distance between 2
            vehicles, so that we could keep safe distance between 2 cars.<br>
