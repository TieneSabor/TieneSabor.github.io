            In NTU aviation club, our ultimate goal is to DIY a RC airplane with
            acceptable cost. Because it is very difficult to fly a RC airplane
            for beginner, we believe a stabilize system is indispensable.
            Therefore, one of the short term goal for this project is to develop
            an Attitude &amp; Heading Reference Systems (AHRS) utilizing data
            from 6 axis or 9 axis accelerometer. We believe that an accurate
            estimation in vehicle heading can be a solid foundation for our
            future development in RC airplane stabilize system. <br>

            The AHRS is based on Joao Luis Marins et al.'s "An Extended Kalman
            Filter for Quaternion-Based Orientation Estimation Using MARG
            Sensors".<br>
            &nbsp;It consists of 4 main components: Linear Algebra Library
            (basic_linear), Quaternion Operation Library (Quaternion_C), Heading
            Estimator (Quaternion_Gauss_Newton), and a Sensor Fusion Estimator
            (Quaternion_EKF).<br>

            The include relation between source code file<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;- Linear Algebra Library provides several matrix operations
            including Addition, Multiplication, Transpose, Cholesky
            Decomposition and Inverse.<br>
            &nbsp;- Quaternion Operation Library provides quaternion operations
            including Addition, Multiplication, Transpose, etc.<br>
            &nbsp;- Heading Estimator provides a Gauss-Newton based method that
            estimate the vehicle heading based on accelerometer data (and
            optionally magnetometer data).<br>
            &nbsp;- Sensor Fusion Estimator uses Extended Kalman Filter that
            combine gyroscope data as well as measured heading (in quaternion)
            to estimate both vehicle heading and gyroscope bias.<br>
            <br>
            The main difference between this AHRS method and the one provided by
            Joao Luis Marins et al. is that this method is compatible with
            vehicles that have only accelerometer and gyroscope. (that is,
            without magnetometer).&nbsp; Also, I implemented this method using
            basi<br>
            The method first estimate the vehicle heading using&nbsp; Heading
            Estimator, then it uses Sensor Fusion Estimator to combine gyroscope
            measurement with heading estimation.&nbsp; Also, we can estimate
            gyroscope bias recursively.<br>

            To validate the Sensor Fusion Estimator, I assume the
            roll angle has a constant rate 0.05 and a constant bias 0.005, then
            I can feed the simulated heading and roll rate measurement into the
            estimator.&nbsp; From the chart, we can see that the estimator has
            successfully estimated the roll rate bias and produce correct roll
            rate estimation.<br>
