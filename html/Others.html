            <h4> Motivation </h4>
            During my internship, my job was to develop a sub-program that could
            calculate the nearest distance from a given point to a Graph with
            arbitrary edges. After studying similar cases, I found it was better
            to use tree-like data structure such as quad-tree and R-tree
            considering accuracy and search speed.&nbsp; I decided to start from
            writing a R-tree from scratch because quad-tree required tiling
            level tuning.&nbsp; Furthermore,&nbsp; I could customize the formula
            that calculates the distance between stored items and given
            points.&nbsp; Moreover, I could have a thorough understanding to
            this topic.<br>
            <h4> Implementation </h4>
            I did some modification in the insertion step.&nbsp; When we
            inserted a new leaf into a tree, if the leaf was not inside of any
            current bounding box, we had to expand one of the bounding
            box.&nbsp; Originally we needed to choose the box that had minimum
            expansion size, and we calculated this value by subtracting the area
            of bounding box after expansion with its original area.&nbsp; I
            found the new leaf was more easily to be inserted into the bigger
            bounding boxes because the expansion size for added into a bigger
            bounding box was often zero.&nbsp; The consequence was that the big
            bounding box would get bigger and affect the knn search efficiency
            because a big bounding box could lead to more overlap area. &nbsp; A
            simple modification that could improve this problem was that we
            skipped the subtraction step, that is, we chose the bounding box
            with "the smallest area after expansion" during insertion.&nbsp;
            This speeded up the knn search by roughly 10~20%.<br>
            <br>
            Besides, I used quadratic split algorithm in the insertion steps. In
            conclusion, this was close to original R-Tree with some
            modifications like one mentioned above. <br>
            <h4> Visualize stored data </h4>
            <p>To make debugging easier, I decided to write a python script that
              visualizes bounding boxes in each level of the current tree.<br>

              The red boxes in the first and second diagram represent bounding
              boxes of different depths (first and second level).&nbsp; The
              black boxes represent leaves nodes at the third level. This
              diagram can easily show the overlaps between different bounding
              boxes in the same depth.</p>
