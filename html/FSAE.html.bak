            My classmates and I started the FSAE team in National Taiwan
            University in pursuit of experiences in engineering practice. After
            discussion, we believe logging sensor data from every sensor can be
            important in this project. <br>
            <br>
            First of all, we need a robust way to send the gas pedal and brake
            signal from the pedals on the car to the motor driver.<br>
            Secondly, data logger can tell us about the race car performance in
            certain part of the race track.<br>
            Lastly, a network that links sensors, vcu and actuators can be a
            preliminary work before developing control systems such as Vehicle
            Traction Control or Torque Vectoring. <br>
            <br>
            As a result, we decided I will lead the electronic team to design
            and produce a data logging system that connect sensors(wheel speed,
            GPS, Inertia Measurement Unit, input from the driver, etc), VCU
            (raspberry Pi 3 B+) and actuators(Motor Driver).<br>

            Regarding many ODM sensors for cars can use CANBUS as communication
            interfaces, as well as CANBUS differential signal can resist larger
            external disturbance, we chose CANBUS as main approach to connect
            individual nodes in our race car. Our nodes include mcus that read
            the sensors and publish data, VCU that control overall behaviors and
            actuators like the motor driver. On our VCU, we process the data to
            monitor the speed, send torque commands to the motor driver via
            CANBUS and log every other data. <br>

            1. The sensor network can successfully receive and send data through
            CANBUS during racing. In fact, it must success or the race car won't
            move.<br>
            2. The logged data can replay in Matlab and we can do the post
            processing.<br>

            1. We will replace arduinos in Front Wheel Node and Rear Wheel Node
            with 32 bit MCU, STM32, to gain better performance, built in CAN
            controller and better understandings in designing MCU firmware. By
            the way, we wrote a higher level driver library above Standard
            Peripheral Library (SPL) in order to have better code reusibility.
            It's now here: <a href="https://github.com/NTURacingTeam/STM_Library">NTU
              Racing STM Library</a> <br>
            2. We will deploy Extended Kalman Filter in order to estimate
            vehicle side slip. By doing so, we can take somesafety measures,
            such as turning off the torque output, when the vehicle lose
            control. In the future, precise side slip and yaw rate estimation
            can be a good reference for our traction control system to guarantee
            the turning stability. We have been testing the estimation algorithm
            on recorded data. <br>
