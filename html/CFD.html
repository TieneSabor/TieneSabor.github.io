            <h4> Course Requirement </h4>
            We need to understand the pressure correction method and apply one
            of the schemes(of Pressure Correction method) on 2 problems: <br>
            <ul>
              <li>Couette Flow</li>
              <li>Lid-Driven Cavity Flow</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Project Goal</h4>
            I decide to replicate the scheme proposed by Suhas Patankar in his
            book "Numerical Heat Transfer and Fluid Flow" Chapt. 5~6. Also, I
            hope to design a set of functions that solve both flow fields with
            different configuration.

            <h4> Abstract </h4>
            The purpose of this project is to understand how simulated particle
            numbers affected the correctness of DSMCFoam. I evaluate the
            correctness by comparing the simulation data with experiments made
            by MARHy in CNRS, and plot the variation of correctness when I
            decreased the particle numbers.

            <h4> Abstract </h4>
            The project goal is to study how shock wave-fuel interaction affects
            combustion. Considering fuel flowing behind the fuel injector, the
            cylindrical "fuel tube" will go through reflected shock wave. If we
            see this scene from behind and along with the fuel moving backward,
            the same thing can be seen as a shock wave swipe through a 2D fuel
            bubble, as shown in the following picture.<br>

              title="DSMCBubble"> <br>
            In Back View part of the picture, we can see a 2D shock wave
            front(Red Line) is passing through a 2D fuel tube.
            <h4> Simulation </h4>
            <img src="../Picture/GIF/DSMCFoam.gif" style="width: 500px; height: 340px;"
              title="DSMCFoam"> <br>
            This is the simulation when the shock wave is passing through 2D
            fuel bubble.&nbsp; We can see the variation of the gas mixture
            density over time.&nbsp; Reaction simulation is not included in this
            animation.<br>
            <h4> Current Work </h4>
            I will compare the simulation result between those with and without
            reaction.&nbsp; If the reaction is simulated, there will be
            combustion happens on the boundary between Oxigen and fuel.&nbsp;
            Therefore, we can see how shock wave affect the combustion.<br>
