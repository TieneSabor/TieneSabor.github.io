            1. We will have to design a "20*30 cm" automative vehicle which is
            driven by a propeller.<br>
            2. It will need to keep itself on a track marked by black duct tape.<br>
            3. It will need to track a set of speed set points with error less
            than 5cm/s.<br>
            4. It will need to overtake another propeller driven vehicle 2 times
            and overtook by that vehicle(also 2 times) when driving on an oval
            tack. <br>

            My job is to design the control system, including the software and
            hardware, to meet the course requirements. My design has following
            features:<br>
            1. I divided the job into 2 parts: the track follow control loop and
            speed control loop, and I deployed them individually on 2 different
            arduino board. This is because it can prevent a temporary failure in
            one loop to interfere another loop. I also connected 2 boards by
            I2C.<br>
            2. We used a series of infra-red sensor to detect the duct tape position. 
            The track follow control is governed by a simple law: if the duct tape is 
            in the left side, then the vehicle will turn right.<br>
            3. We used optical encoder to measure current wheel speed and used a PID 
            controller to calculate the propeller motor torque command.  We also record
            current mileage to determine when we want to "overtake" one another.<br>
            4. We used a ultra-sonic sensor to measure the distance between 2 vehicles,
            so that we can keep safe distance between 2 cars.<br>
